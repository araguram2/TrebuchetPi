# Trebuchet Pi

This is a project with a Drivable Trebuchet with a Raspberry Pi attached to it and 	a controller with a Particle Photon. A joystick is connected to the Particle 		Photon that sends analog data (direction of steering, going forward, firing),
which then sends info to the Raspberry Pi on the Trebuchet via a connection. The
Raspberry Pi then controls the motors on the Trebuchet accordingly.
